# Doctor Doomscroll


## Basic Details
### Team Name: BackSpace


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Govind Mohan - SCMS School Of Engineering And Technology
- Member 2: Aaqil Fazil - GECT


### Project Description
Dr DoomScroll is the browser extension that cheerfully tracks your infinite doomscroll through YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels, counting each pointless video and roasting you with meme pop-ups as you spiral further. When you finally hit your totally arbitrary limit, it closes your tab‚Ä¶ but, let‚Äôs be honest, you‚Äôll probably just open another.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We are trying to solve the problem of unintentional, excessive consumption of short-form video content, which leads to a loss of time, focus, and digital well-being.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Dr DoomScroll tracks your YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels viewing, counting how many you watch and timing your scrolling. As you reach milestones, it overlays escalating Mr. Incredible memes with witty roasts mocking your doomscrolling habit. Once you hit your set limit, it blocks access and closes tabs to make you face the consequences.
